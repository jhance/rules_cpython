A hermetic rules_python toolchain for building cpython from source, statically linked.

Based on the original implementation from https://github.com/dropbox/dbx_build_tools and
tweaked so that it can also work with @rules_python instead of requiring internal dbx tools.

You still need to use the original rules_python toolchain (or another one) in order to
bootstrap the interpreter's zip files. This is controlled via a transition which swaps
to the system interpreter for the construction of the py_binary that is used for zipping
the stdlib.

## Usage

```console
cpython = use_extension("@rules_cpython//:extensions.bzl", "cpython_toolchain")
cpython.declare(version="3.12.10")
use_repo(cpython, "cpython3_12")

register_toolchains(
    "@cpython3_12//:toolchain",
    # if you want to be able to link c extensions
    "@cpython3_12//:cc_toolchain",
)
```
