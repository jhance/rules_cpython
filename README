A hermetic rules_python toolchain for building cpython from source, statically linked.

Based on the original implementation from https://github.com/dropbox/dbx_build_tools and
tweaked so that it can also work with @rules_python instead of requiring internal dbx tools.

You still need to use the original rules_python toolchain (or another one) in order to
bootstrap the interpreter's zip files. This is controlled via a transition which swaps
to the system interpreter for the construction of the py_binary that is used for zipping
the stdlib.

## Usage

```console
cpython = use_extension("@rules_cpython//:extensions.bzl", "cpython_toolchain")
cpython.declare(version="3.12.10")
use_repo(cpython, "cpython3_12")

register_toolchains(
    "@cpython3_12//:toolchain",
    # if you want to be able to link c extensions
    "@cpython3_12//:cc_toolchain",
)
```

There is a good chance that in the event of new releases of minor python versions,
the specific python version you want might not be available. In this case, you can
pass the integrity value manually in the `.declare()` extension.

We also support passing a custom url for the download.
